5. Scroll a little to uncover the menu, where it gives you the option to save or import and export and so on, and click on the import and save option.

6. There you can paste the text from the Mtab-save text file in the repo.

7. Click on ok and enjoy! Feel free to change the image url to something nice you found on the internet or a direct .jpg or .png file.

8. There is also a .json file in the repo, be sure to check that out! At the bottom of the mtab config settings page, there is an option to turn the snow effect out, check that out!

Leave a star if you liked the config!
